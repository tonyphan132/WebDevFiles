                    Feeding
                </h3>
                <p>
                    We recommend purchasing high-quality, brand-name kitten or cat food. 
                Your veterinarian will be able to assess your new cat or kitten and determine the best diet. 
                Factors such as age, activity level and health make a difference in what and how much a cat should eat.
                </p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Cats require taurine, an essential amino acid, for heart and eye health.
                             The food you choose should be balanced for the life stage of your cat or kitten. 
                             Properly balanced foods will contain taurine.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            You will need to provide fresh, clean water at all times, 
                            and wash and refill your catâ€™s water bowls daily.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Treats should be no more than 5-10% of the diet.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Many people feed baby food to a cat or kitten who is refusing food or not feeling well  Please read labels carefully: If the baby food contains onion or garlic powder, your pet could be poisoned.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Take your pet to your veterinarian if signs of anorexia, diarrhea, vomiting or lethargy continue for more than two days.</p>

                <h3>
                    Grooming
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Most cats stay relatively clean and rarely need a bath, but you should brush or comb your cat regularly. Frequent brushing helps keep your cat's coat clean, reduces the amount of shedding and cuts down on the incidence of hairballs.
                </p>

                <h3>
                    Handling
                </h3>
                <p>
                    To pick up your cat, place one hand behind the front legs and another under the hindquarters. Lift gently. Never pick up a cat by the scruff of the neck or by the front legs.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Housing
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Your pet should have her own clean, dry place in your home to sleep and rest. Line your cat's bed with a soft, warm blanket or towel. Be sure to wash the bedding often. Please keep your cat indoors. Outdoor cats do not live as long as indoor cats. Outdoor cats are at risk of trauma from cars, or from fights with other cats, raccoons and free-roaming dogs. Coyotes are known to eat cats. Outdoor cats are more likely to become infested with fleas or ticks, as well as contract infectious diseases.
                </p>

                    Litter Box
                </h3>
                <p>
                    All indoor cats need a litter box, which should be placed in a quiet, accessible location. In a multi-level home, one box per floor is recommended. Avoid moving the box unless absolutely necessary, but if you must do so, move the box just a few inches per day. Keep in mind that cats won't use a messy, smelly litter box, so scoop solid wastes out of the box at least once a day.
                </p>
